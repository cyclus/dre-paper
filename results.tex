\section{Experimentation \& Results}\label{results}

The model flexibility and generality that the DRE provides is demonstrated using
three scenarios. 

First, a base case is presented. 

\subsection{Base Case}

\subsection{Fuel Cycles with Demand Fungibility}

% general cycle layout

% single cycle example

% large scale simulation

% solver comparison

\subsection{Fuel Cycles with International Instruments}

% general cycle layout
