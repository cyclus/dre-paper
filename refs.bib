	abstract = {The nuclear fuel cycle describes the process of the evolution of nuclear fuel from mining to eventual
interment. It is a complex system comprised of supplier and consumer facilities which act in a global
context. It is cyclical, i.e., fuel is not simply used and disposed of in all cases; the notion of the recycling
and reuse of fuel must be taken into account. Further complicating the analysis of the nuclear fuel cycle
are competing metrics, such as overall cost, repository capacity, support facility capacity, etc. Nuclear fuel
cycle simulators have been developed in order to ascertain the effect of different fuel cycle options, such
as fuel types, reactor types, and technology availability. Previous simulation technologies have relied
primarily on pure system dynamics approaches. This work describes an agent-based modeling approach
that allows increased modeling flexibility through the use of dynamically loadable agent actors. A linear
programming and mixed integer-linear programming variation of the multi-commodity transportation
problem is proposed to be used in the simulation framework to facilitate the matching of suppliers and
consumers of commodities. Modeling of recycling scenarios is achieved through a proposed approxima-
tion linear programming formulation with domain-specific constraints, allowing separated material to
be matched to multiple target fuel requests. The combination of the market resolution mechanism with
an automated recipe matching algorithm placed in the framework of the Cyclus simulation provides a
first-of-the-kind application of a dynamic, agent-based model of the nuclear fuel cycle.},
