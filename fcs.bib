	abstract = {As an international nuclear company and one which is involved throughout the nuclear fuel cycle, a complete (holistic) understanding of the technicalities and economics of a range of nuclear fuel cycles is an important part of Nexia Solutions' business. To this end, Nexia Solutions has developed the capability to model and assess a range of reactor systems and fuel cycles using both “off the shelf” as well as bespoke software, including tools developed in-house. This paper presents a range of potential United Kingdom ({UK}) specific nuclear fuel cycle options for current, near, medium and long-term deployment that have been evaluated using these analysis tools and capabilities. These fuel cycles illustrate how the {UK} could utilize the plutonium stockpile and highlights some of the key issues for {UK} new nuclear build scenarios in the near, medium and long term.},

	title = {Essential Physics for Fuel Cycle Modeling \& Analysis},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycles ({NFC}) are the collection of interconnected processes
which generate electricity through nuclear power. Due to the high degree of
coupling between components even in the simplest cycles, the need for a dynamic
fuel cycle simulator and analysis framework arises. The work presented
herein develops essential physics models of nuclear power reactors and incorporate
them into a {NFC} simulation framework.
First, a one-energy group reactor model is demonstrated. This essential
physics model is then to simulate a sampling fuel cycles which are perturbations
of well known base-case cycles. Because the {NFC} may now be simulated
quickly, stochastically modeling many fuel cycle realizations dramatically expands
the parameter space which may be analyzed. Finally, a multigroup
reactor model which incorporates spectral changes as a function of burnup is
presented to increase the fidelity of the original one-group reactor.
These methods form a suite of modeling technologies which reach from
the lowest levels (individual components) to the highest (inter-cycle comparisons). Prior to the development of this model suite, such broad-ranging analysis
had been unrealistic to perform. The work here thus presents a new,
multi-scale approach to fuel cycle system design.},

Especially in the light of the different roadmap exercises that have been undertaken in the past years indicating the need for symbiotic nuclear energy systems in the longer term. The symbiosis between different nuclear reactor types and their associated fuel cycle should fulfill competing objectives for such systems, i.e. economics, environmental friendliness, resource longevity, waste management, and non-proliferation. A new code, dubbed {DANESS}, has been developed which allows performing such dynamic analysis of nuclear energy systems composed of multiple reactors and fuel cycle options including cross-flow of fissile material between the different components of the system. Today, the code allows mass-flow analysis and economics and is currently being extended to include life-cycle analysis data, non-proliferation metrics and non-nuclear energy sources. This paper will describe the main features of this code and will indicate the possible uses and future developments.},

The code uses the matrix exponential method to solve a large system of coupled, linear, first-order ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.  The general nature of the matrix exponential method permits the treatment of complex decay and transmutation schemes.  An extensive library of nuclear data has been compiled, including half-lives and decay schemes, neutron absorbtion, cross sections, fission yields, disintegration energies, and multigroup photon release data.  {ORIGEN} has been used to compute the compositions and radiactivity of fission products, cladding materials, and fuel materials in {LWRs}, {LMFBRs}, {MSBRs}, and {HTGRs}.  The applications are illustrated with calculated inventories and radiation levels for spent fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 {MWd}/metric ton in a {PWR} spectrum.},
