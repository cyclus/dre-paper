notes from cyclus call
- why is total inventory the same?
- add sep facility outage case
- stagger reloads? (maybe have to stagger installs)
- add once-through "base case"

a more natural way for people to investigate fuel cycles
- preferences
- disruptions
- don't have to rewire it

may need to zoom in on some features
